Here is some testing of some math using \LaTeX\ and plas\TeX.
But before we test any math, here is some text.
One TODO I have is to make the blog sections have wider text.
The main / front pages are fine as is, but the blog posts should have something different, something wider.

We already know that the following work:
\begin{itemize}
\item itemize
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item enumerate
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}

  \begin{tabular}{|c|}

\subsection*{Some Differential Geometry}

Let $D$ be a compact $m$-dimensional oriented domain with boundary $\partial D$, $N$ a manifold, $F\colon \partial D \to N$ a smooth map, and $\omega \in \Omega^{m - 1}(N)$ a closed form.
Prove that if $F$ can be extended to a smooth map $\tilde{F}\colon D \to N$ then $\int_{\partial D} F^{*}\omega = 0$.

Since $\omega$ is closed, we have that $\text{d} \omega = 0$.
Then since $F = \tilde{F}\bigm|_{\partial D}$ we have that $\int_{\partial D} F^{*}\omega = \int_{\partial D} \tilde{F}^{*}\omega$.
Thus we have
\[
  \int_{\partial D} F^{*}\omega = \int_{\partial D} \tilde{F}^{*}\omega = \int_{D} \text{d} \left(\tilde{F}^{*}\omega\right) = \int_{D} \tilde{F}^{*}(\text{d} \omega) = \int_{D} \tilde{F}^{*}(0) = 0.
\]

Show that the bilinear multiplication on any associative algebra over $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the Jacobi identity.

We will denote $a \circ b$ as $ab$ for all $a, b \in A$.
A computation yields the desired result.
\begin{align*}
  [x, [y, z]] &= [x, yz - zy] \\
              &= x(yz - zy) - (yz - zy)x \\
              &= xyz - xzy - yzx + zyx \\
              &= xyz - yxz - zxy + zyx + yxz - yzx - xzy + zxy \\
              &= (xy - yx)z - z(xy - yx) + y(xz - zx) - (xz - zx)y \\
              &= [xy - yx, z] + [y, xz - zx] = [[x, y], z] + [y, [x, z]]
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Computer Science}

In addition to mathematics, computer science will also be discussed.
However, the algorithm environment currently does not work.
So just mathematics and computer science without algorithms will be discussed.

\subsection*{Image Testing}
