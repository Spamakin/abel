# Abel

This is the build system for the (soon to exist) blog commutative.group.
Following the name of the blog, this build system is named after [Niels Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel).

### Requirements

Abel uses [plasTeX](https://github.com/plastex/plastex) (currently version 3.0). To build SVGs for the `algo` and `nalgo` environment automatically you also need [pdf2svg](https://github.com/dawbarton/pdf2svg) 0.2.3. For debugging purposes, something to view SVGs would be helpful such as ImageMagick or Inkscape.
