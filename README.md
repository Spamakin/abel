# Abel

This is the build system for the blog [commutative.group](https://www.commutative.group/).
The resulting code generated by this tool can be found at this [repository](https://github.com/Spamakin/commutative.group).
Following the name of the blog, this build system is named after [Niels Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel).

### Requirements

Abel uses [plasTeX](https://github.com/plastex/plastex).
To build PNGs for the `algo` and `nalgo` environment automatically you need [PyMuPDF](https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/).
PDFCrop is also necessary but should come with your system.
Of course, working installations of [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) complete with [latexmk](https://www.cantab.net/users/johncollins/latexmk/index.html) are required.
